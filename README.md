## Pursuit Workshop: Linkages of agrobiodiversity in urban systems and food-producing landscapes

Supporting the biodiversity of food systems amid expanding urbanization is one of the main challenges facing humanity. This Pursuit addresses two major knowledge-policy gaps in this domain:

(1) the biodiversity of food-producing landscapes (rural, periurban, urban) linked to urbanization;

(2) contemporary urbanization dynamics and their linkages to food systems. 

The overarching questions addressed by this Pursuit are: 

- How do food-producing systems correspond to characteristic landscapes and connect to food supply chains and in turn how do these factors shape agrobiodiversity? 
- How does the process of urbanization reshape the demand for food systems, and how does this in turn shape food diversity and landscapes?
- What are the processes and pathways by which food-producinglandscapes, production systemsand urbanization processes (e.g., food demand) are linked and affect each other?
