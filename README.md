## [Linkages of agrobiodiversity in urban systems and food-producing landscapes][1]

Supporting the biodiversity of food systems amid expanding urbanization is a major challenge. This Pursuit addresses two major knowledge-policy gaps in this domain:

1. the biodiversity of food-producing landscapes (rural, periurban, urban) linked to urbanization;

1. contemporary urbanization dynamics and their linkages to food systems. 

The overarching questions addressed by this Pursuit are: 

- How do food-producing systems correspond to characteristic landscapes and connect to food supply chains and in turn how do these factors shape agrobiodiversity? 
- How does the process of urbanization reshape the demand for food systems, and how does this in turn shape food diversity and landscapes?
- What are the processes and pathways by which food-producinglandscapes, production systemsand urbanization processes (e.g., food demand) are linked and affect each other?
