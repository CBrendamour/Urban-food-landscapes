# SESYNC Pursuit

## [Linkages of agrobiodiversity in urban systems and food-producing landscapes][1]

Supporting the biodiversity of food systems amid expanding urbanization is a major challenge. This Pursuit addresses two major knowledge-policy gaps in this domain:

1. the biodiversity of food-producing landscapes (rural, periurban, urban) linked to urbanization;

1. contemporary urbanization dynamics and their linkages to food systems. 

The overarching questions addressed by this Pursuit are: 

- How do food-producing systems correspond to characteristic landscapes and connect to food supply chains and in turn how do these factors shape agrobiodiversity? 
- How does the process of urbanization reshape the demand for food systems, and how does this in turn shape food diversity and landscapes?
- What are the processes and pathways by which food-producinglandscapes, production systemsand urbanization processes (e.g., food demand) are linked and affect each other?


## Objectives for CYBER training week


(i) Understanding the tools available, setting up some generic scripts that could potentially applied at a later stage

(ii) do some tentative data analysis with teh sample dataset


## Outomces

Ad (i) ...

Ad (ii) ?


## Take-aways/ next steps

(i) Helpful to be prepared!!!

(ii) Bring at least some of the team

(ii) Get information on the types of data that people bring to the table
